Exercise 2: Java basics
Create a simple Department class that can hold a Map (Student, Integer) with student grades.
The student class has the attributes name and last name.
The department class should have two methods:
One method that allows to add a student and its grade into the map. If a student to add has the same last name that an student already added to the map then the existing entry should be replaced with the new entry.
One method that allows to print each student and the mark.
